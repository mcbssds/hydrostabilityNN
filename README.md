The diary and associated result files included in this repository were generated 
using MATLAB R2024b running on a 2018 MacBook Pro running MacOS 13.6.9. 

The driver for generating <i>symmetry-breaking</i> channel flow data is<br>
<TT>flowtest.m</TT>
The associated diary file for representative model parameters is<br>
<TT>flowtest5.txt</TT><br>

The driver for generating recirculating <i>Rayleigh-Benard convection</i> data is<br>
<TT>raytest.m</TT>
The associated diary file for representative model parameters is<br>
<TT>raytest32.txt</TT><br>

The driver for generating periodic solutions to the <i>Elder test problem</i> is<br>
<TT>wubstest.m</TT>
The associated diary file for representative model parameters is<br>
<TT>wubstest32.txt</TT><br>

The results in the paper were generated using Python 3.9.6 

The channel flow results in figures 6,7 and 8 can be
generated by executing the following commands in
a Python terminal window<br>
<TT>exec(open("./flowdataNN.py").read(),globals())<br>
exec(open("./flowclass.py").read(),globals())<br> 
exec(open("./flowdatacheck.py").read(),globals())<br> </TT>

The Rayleigh-Benard results in figures 10 and 11 can be
generated by executing the following commands in
a Python terminal window<br>
<TT>exec(open("./raydataNN.py").read(),globals())<br>
exec(open("./rayclass.py").read(),globals())<br> </TT>

The Elder test problem results in figures 14 and 15 can be
generated by executing the following commands in
a Python terminal window<br>
<TT>exec(open("./wubsdataNN.py").read(),globals())<br>
exec(open("./wubsclass.py").read(),globals())<br> </TT>
